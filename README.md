5CCE2ENG   Design:   Engagement   - Individual   Coursework
Reflecting on Sustainability, Systems Thinking, Stakeholder Relations, Innovation Processes,   and Material Choices in Relation to   the   Group Project
The individual report counts   for 30% towards the   final grade, and   you must   be prepared to put   considerable work   into this   part.   It is due on Tuesday   11th March,   4pm.This individual coursework is designed to encourage you to reflect on and apply the core concepts and   skills   introduced   in   Sessions   1-5   (Weeks   22-26) of the module. You will draw upon   the   knowledge   and   tools    from these sessions      –      such as sustainability, systems thinking, innovation, and life cycle   assessment   (LCA)   –   to   analyse   and   critically   engage   with   the   challenge   and   design   your   group   has   selected   for   the   Group   Project.   Your   report   should   demonstrate   how   the   concepts   and   frameworks   learned in these sessions inform. your approach to the design process and the sustainability challenges   at   hand.This report should provide both a reflective analysis of the module’s content and a detailed   justification of the design solution your group is pursuing. You will be expected to demonstrate critical   thinking, the ability to apply course concepts to real-world      problems, and clear professional   communication.
Assignment   Structure and   Requirements
Your   individual coursework   report should be structured as follows:
1.          Introduction   (300-400 words):
•          Briefly   introduce the   challenge your   group   is   addressing for   the   Group   Project   and   explain   its   connection to the   United   Nations Sustainable Development Goals   (SDGs).
•          Identify   the   specific   aspect   of   your   group’s   design   that   you   will   focus   on    in   this    coursework   and   explain why   it   is   critical   to   reflect   on   this   aspect   in   relation   to   sustainability,   innovation,   and   entrepreneurship.
•          Summarise the   key concepts   from   Sessions   1-5   (Weeks   22-26)   that are   relevant   to   the   design   challenge and that will   be discussed   in   your   report.
2.          Main   Body (1200-1500   words):
•          Reflection   on   Sessions   1-5   in   relation   to   your   group   project:
-    Session    1   (Introduction   to    sustainability   and   the    Dilemma   game):   reflect   on   how   the   principles   of   sustainability,   introduced   through   the   Dilemma   game   and   the   SDG   cards,   have   shaped   your   understanding   of   your   group’s   project   challenge.   How   do   the   SDGs   influence the design approach?
-    Session 2   (Systems   Thinking   and   the   FishBanks   game):   discuss   how   the   systems   thinking   and feedback mechanisms, explored in the FishBanks game, have informed your   understanding   of   the   complexity   within   your project’s   design   and   challenge. How do   interconnected systems   play a   role   in your design solution?
-    Session   3   (Sustainability   in   business and   the   REXUS   game):    evaluate   how sustainability   in   business,   value   creation,   and   stakeholder   negotiations—covered   in   this   session—are   relevant   to   your    project. How are you incorporating commercial considerations and   stakeholder   interests   into   your   design   solution?
-    Session   4   (Innovation   processes):    reflect   on   the   role   of   innovation   in   your   project.    How   do   the   stages   of   innovation   and   the   strategies   for fostering   innovation   discussed   in   this   session   influence the development of your design?
-    Session      5    (Design      for      sustainability      and      Life      Cycle      Assessment,      LCA):       analyse    how   sustainability   considerations   are   embedded   in   your   group   project,   particularly   through   the lens of LCA.   How are environmental, social, and economic   factors integrated into   your   design   decisions, and   how   does   LCA   inform. your group’sapproach?
•            Linking Sessions to Your   Group   Project:
-    Demonstrate   how the   key   learnings   from these sessions have   shaped your group’s   design   process,   addressing   the   sustainability,    innovation,   and   commercial   challenges   you   are   facing.
-    Provide   examples   of   how   the   theories   and   frameworks   learned   in   the   module   influence   your design   decisions,   considering   both the sustainability and   commercial aspects   of the   project.
3.          Conclusion   (300-400 words):
•          Summarise the   key   insights from your   reflection   and   analysis,   linking them   back   to   the   group   project.    What have you learned about the design   process in relation to sustainability,   innovation,   and   entrepreneurship?
•          Reflect   on   your    personal   contribution   to   the   group    project   and   how   the    learning   from   this   coursework has   influenced your   approach to the challenge.

Non-Mandatory Sub-Parts
Optional   but   recommended   for   deeper   learning   and   reflectionThese   sub-parts are   designed to help you engage more   deeply   with the content and develop a stronger   connection   between   the   module’s   learning   objectives   and   your   group   project. While these sub-parts   are   not   mandatory, they will   be useful for your report   and   are   highly   recommended.
Peer-Review ProcessAs   part of your engagement with the module and   this coursework, you will   have an option   to   participate   in the   peer   review   process.   Each week   during the first   half   of the   module   (following submissions   of the   sub-parts,   i.e.   weeks   23-27),   you   will   review   and   provide   constructive   feedback   on   a   peer’s   individual   coursework. This   process   allows you to   refine your   own critical   thinking and feedback   skills,   which   are   essential for   professional   practice. The   peer-review expectations   are:
•          Provide   constructive, well-reasoned,   and   actionable   feedback   on the   sub-part   report.
•          Focus   on   strengths   and   areas   for   improvement   in   relation   to   the   coursework   content,   design   solution, and communication.
•          Ensure your feedback   is   professional,   clear,   and   helpful   for   your   peer’sdevelopment.For   each   sub-part   where   you   (i)   submit   a   complete   assignment   including   all   tasks,   and   (ii)   perform   a   thorough   peer   review of a   peer’s submission for the   same sub-part, you will receive feedback from one   of your   peers.You should aim to spend 2-3 hours per week on the follow-up assignments including   peer-review. This   is essentially a preparation for your individual report, and you will be able to   reuse a   lot of the content   that   you   produce   for   the   sub-parts.
Sub-part   1: Values Thinking   (Dilemma game)
Task: reflect on the importance   of values   thinking in engineering design.Reflect on   what   insights you take away from the   values thinking   seminar   and   discuss   how   awareness   of values thinking can   influence your   approach to   engineering design.   Consider what   role values   play   in   sustainability and   design   decisions.
Identify a value-based   dilemma, similar to those you encountered   in the   game,   but   which   relates   to
the discipline of   engineering.   Search the   internet for facts   and arguments that deepen your   understanding of the dilemma.
Your task   is to discuss   both   sides of the dilemma   by following these five steps:
1.          Give a   brief explanation of the subject   and   why   it   has   the   characteristics   of   a   'dilemma'.
2.          Specify some core arguments for   one   of the   positions   (use   references   when   needed).
3.          Counter the arguments   by expressing the view   of   a   person   who   disagrees   with   the first   position.
4.          Finish the assignment by once again taking the   original   viewpoint.
5.          Finally –   reflect   upon the constructive   debate   exercise   and   the   polarity   map   –   how   could   that way of thinking add to your   dilemma   discussion?   (1-4 sentences)
Develop your thoughts   and opinions   so that a   reader   can   clearly   understand your   reasoning.   Debate   with well-supported arguments and   make sure to   clarify what facts   or   values   your assertions   are based   upon.   One tip   is not to   let go   of the thoughts   behind an   argument too   early. Always   try   to answer   any of the questions “why?”, “when?”,   “how?”   and   “what?”   so   that the   reader   is   not   left to   interpret the claims themselves. Also, do not   underestimate   the   power   of   examples, when   trying to   explain   a   certain   mindset.
Please   note that your   own   opinion   is not   relevant in this exercise.   In   order   to   assure   the   quality   of         your arguments you   may want to test them against the three   assessment criteria   used   in   the   game   Dilemma:
1.          Analysis: are conclusions and   propositions   sensible,   reasonable and   correct?
2.          Convincing:   are the arguments   convincing? Could anyone   else be   inspired   to   debate   in   the   same manner?
3.          Rational: are the arguments   logically   constructed?   Does   the opponent   reply on   the other   one’s   argument or   are there gaps   in the   logic?
An   additional   method for quality assurance   is to   check   if your text   has   a good   “flow”;   how   does   it
work to   read the text out   loud? The   presence of conjunctions   such   as ‘   because’,   ‘   in   addition’, ‘since’,   ‘thus’, and ‘which’, give a   hint that your you   text has   a   flow.
Optional extra   material (extra-curricular): watch this TED-talk about   polarities and   how to   manage   them, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jqd4-eemoAw
Sub-part   2: Systems Thinking (FishBanks   game)
Task: apply systems   thinking to your group project.
Identify a   system   relevant to the group project challenge   (either directly   relevant   or   peripherally   relevant), which   should 代 写5CCE2ENG Design: Engagement – Individual CourseworkC/C++
代做程序编程语言  be similar to   FishBanks   in the sense that it   can   be   describe   in   terms   of stocks,   flows and   connections.
Describe the system   and the feedback   loops driving it.   Include   a   causal-loop   diagram   to   visualise   the   system, and   explain   how   it is   connected to your   project.   Consider   system   boundaries and   how   feedback   mechanisms   can   influence design decisions.   Describe stocks, flows,   and   connections, and   whether there are delays   in the   system that   influence   its   behaviour.   Further,   describe   potential   system   states   (stable or   meta-stable), and whether the system   may   transform   between   them suddenly when   certain tipping   points   are exceeded   due to   exceeding the   resilience of the system.
Sub-part   3: Sustainability in   Business and Stakeholder   Negotiations   (REXUS Game)
Task: apply sustainability principles in business   and stakeholder negotiations,   using the   REXUS game   as   areference   point.
Note:   this sub-part has   a rather long description – but it is   actually   rather straightforward   to execute.
In this sub-part, you will focus   on the application   of sustainability   principles   in   the   context   of   business   and   stakeholder negotiations.   Drawing from the   insights   gained   in the   REXUS game, you will   consider   how   different stakeholders with   competing interests   affect the design and   implementation of sustainable solutions. You will analyse   how these dynamics   play out   in   real-world   scenarios,   especially   in   engineering   projects where stakeholders   may   have differing views on   sustainability   goals, resource allocation,   and   long-term   impact.
Step 1: Understand the Stakeholder Landscape
In the   REXUS game,   players   experience the complexity of managing   the   Water-Food-Energy   Nexus,   where stakeholders   (e.g., governments,   businesses,   communities, environmental groups) have   competing interests   and   priorities. Your first task is to   identify the   key stakeholders   relevant to   your   group project challenge. These could   include clients,   local   communities,   environmental   groups,   government agencies,   or supply chain partners.
Reflect on the following questions:
•          Who   are   the   main   stakeholders   in   your   group   project’schallenge?
•          What are their   key   concerns   or   priorities when   it   comes   to   sustainability   (e.g.,   environmental   impact,   cost efficiency, social justice)?
•          How   might these stakeholders   have   conflicting   goals,   and   how   might this   affect the   design   decisions your group   makes?
Step   2: Stakeholder   Analysis   and   Mapping
Using your   understanding of the stakeholder   landscape,   conduct astakeholder analysis. This   analysis   should help you   map the power,   influence, and   interests   of   each   stakeholder,   similar   to   the   REXUS game’s approach to balancing   resource allocation while   considering   competing needs.
Tasks to   include:
•          Identify the   key   interests and   concerns   of   each   stakeholder   group.
•          Classify stakeholders   based on   their   power   and   influence   over   the   project   (e.g.,   high   power,   low   interest vs.   high   power,   high   interest).
•          Discuss   potential conflicts   between   stakeholders   –   how   might these   conflicts   impact the   success of your   project and   its   sustainability goals?
Step 3: Negotiation Strategies and Conflict Resolution
Reflect on the   negotiation   tactics you   encountered   in the   REXUS game.   In   that   game,   participants were   required to   negotiate compromises and make decisions that   balance   competing   sustainability   goals while   meeting   business needs.   For your group   project, think   about the following:
•          What   negotiation   strategies would you   employ to   manage   conflicting   stakeholder   interests?
•          How can   you   usestakeholder   mapping   and   power   analysis   to   prioritise   actions   and find win-   win   solutions?
•          Are there ethical considerations   involved   in   negotiating   with   stakeholders who   may   prioritise profit over   environmental or social   concerns?
•          What trade-offs   need to   be considered   in   order   to find   an   acceptable solution   for all   stakeholders?
Reflect on   how these strategies will apply to your group   project,   and   explain   how   effective negotiation   can   help   achieve both sustainability goals and the   project’s   commercial objectives.
Step   4: Sustainability   Trade-offs   and   Long-term   Impacts
In the   REXUS game,   participants   must consider   long-term   sustainability while negotiating short-term   benefits. Apply this principle to your group   project.   Consider:
•          How   might short-term   business goals   conflict with   long-term   sustainability   goals?
•          What   potential trade-offs   might emerge   in your   design   process   (e.g.,   environmental   impact   vs.   economic gain)?
•          Discuss   how these trade-offs   could affect the   project's   success,   and   how   you can   balance   the   immediate   needs   of stakeholders with   long-term   sustainability objectives.
Step 5: Reflection on   the Application of   Sustainability Principles
Finally,   reflect on how the principles   of sustainability   in   business   and stakeholder   negotiations,   as   discussed   in the   REXUS game, will guide your   approach to   the   group   project   challenge.   Consider   how   stakeholder   engagement and negotiation tactics will affect the   design   process and   the   overall   sustainability of the   solution.
•          How will   you   ensure   that   sustainability   is   incorporated   throughout the   project’s   lifecycle?
•          What steps   can you take   to   facilitate   effective   stakeholder   collaboration,   especially   when   interests   conflict?
•          How   can you   balance   environmental,   social,   and   economic factors   in   the   design   solution   your group is   proposing?
Additional   Guidance:
Research and   External Sources: to   deepen your   understanding of stakeholder   negotiations and sustainability   in   business, you   are encouraged to research   relevant case   studies   or   theories.   Use   credible external sources to support your analysis   and   reflect on   real-world   examples where   stakeholder negotiations   played   a crucial   role   in sustainable   business practices.   Cite these sources   appropriately   in your   report.
Visual Aids: consider   including diagrams or frameworks to help   map stakeholders,   analyse their   interests, or visualise   negotiation   strategies. This will help   clarify your arguments   and   enhance   the   professionalism of your report.
Expected   Deliverables:
Written Analysis: your analysis should be   between 400-500 words,   not   including   references.   Ensure   that your writing is   clear,   concise, and   well-supported with   evidence from the   REXUS   game,   course         materials, and   any additional   research.
Citations and   References:   properly cite all external   sources   you   use   in your   analysis, following the   Harvard referencing style.
By completing this sub-part, you will deepen your   understanding of   how   sustainability considerations   in business   and stakeholder   negotiations   shape the decision-making   process   in   engineering   projects. You will also   develop the critical   skills   necessary to    manage complex stakeholder relationships while   balancing commercial and   sustainability objectives.
Sub-part 4:   Design Thinking
Task: apply Design   Thinking principles   to your group project.
In this sub-part, you will reflect on   how   Design Thinking   can   be   applied   to   the   challenge your   group   is   addressing.   Design Thinking is   a   human-cantered   approach that emphasises   empathy,   ideation, and prototyping.   It encourages you to   iterate on   solutions   based   on   user feedback   and   to   focus   on finding innovative solutions that   meet   real-world   needs.
Steps to   complete the task:
•          Empathy:   reflect on   the   users or   stakeholders   involved   in   your   project.   Who   are   they,   and   what are their needs, frustrations, and goals?   How   can   you   incorporate   their   perspectives   into the   design   process?
•          Ideation:   discuss how   your   group   has   brainstormed   possible   solutions   to   the   problem.   What   methods   (e.g.,   brainstorming sessions,   mind-mapping)   did you   use to generate   ideas?   How did you   prioritise and   select ideas for further development?
•          Prototyping:   reflect on   how   prototyping or   testing   concepts   maybe   useful for your group   project.   How   might   rapid prototyping   help   refine your design solutions?
Sub-part   5:   Life Cycle Assessment   (LCA)
Task: perform. a simplified Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)   for your group project.
In this sub-part, you will apply the tools   and   methods   for   Life   Cycle Assessment   (LCA)   that   were   introduced   during the workshop. Your task   is to   perform. a   simplified   LCA   on   different components   of   your group project design. The goal   is to   assess   the   environmental   impacts   associated   with   each   component,   considering factors such as raw material extraction,   manufacturing,   use,   and disposal.
Steps to   complete the task:
•          Divide the work:   as   a   group, divide   the   components   of   your   design   and   assign   each   group   member   a different component to   analyse   using the   LCA tools   provided   in the workshop.      Ensure that the analysis   covers all stages of the product’s   lifecycle   (e.g.,   production, transportation, use,   end-of-life).
•          Perform. the   LCA: for   each   component,   analyse   the   environmental   impacts   at   each   stage   of   the   lifecycle.   Focus on   key factors that are relevant for sustainability, such as   energy   use, resource depletion,   carbon footprint, and waste generation.
•          Consolidate findings: once   each   group   member   has   completed   their   LCA   for   a   component, come together to   compare and discuss the   results.   Identify any   areas   where   improvements   can   be made to   reduce the environmental   impact of your design.
•          Reflection:   in your   report,   briefly   reflect   on   the   results   of   the   LCA.   Were   there   any   surprising   findings?   How might the   LCA   influence the design decisions you   make going forward?   What         trade-offs   between   sustainability and   other   project factors (e.g.,   cost, functionality) need   to      be considered?
